            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>I am a skilled backend app developer with strong experience in designing and implementing server-side
                architectures, creating APIs, and managing databases. My expertise lies in languages like Golang and
                Python,
                where I build efficient, secure, and scalable solutions. I have experience working with relational
                databases
                (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL databases (MongoDB). My education in Mechatronics Engineering has provided
                a
                solid foundation in software development, electronics, and systems integration, enhancing my
                understanding
                of complex backend operations. During my internships and work experience, I have collaborated with
                cross-functional teams, contributed to large-scale projects, and successfully delivered backend
                solutions
                that streamline processes, improve system performance, and meet client requirements.</p>

                <h3>Inventory Management system</h3>
                <p>The Inventory Management System API is a backend project designed to streamline the process of
                    tracking and managing inventory for businesses. It is built using Golang and utilizes a PostgreSQL
                    database for efficient data storage. The API allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update,
                    Delete) operations on products, categories, and stock levels. Key features include:

                    User Authentication: Secure login and registration using JWT tokens.
                    Inventory Tracking: Real-time updates for product stock levels.
                    Data Analytics: Generates reports on sales, restocking needs, and product trends.
                    API Documentation: Comprehensive API documentation using Swagger for easy integration with frontend
                    applications.
                    This project demonstrates proficiency in API development, database management, and implementing
                    secure, scalable backend systems.</p>

                <h3>Smart Home Control App</h3>
                <p>The Smart Home Control App is a mobile application developed to provide users with an intuitive
                    interface for managing their smart home devices. Built using React Native for a cross-platform
                    experience (iOS and Android), the app connects to a backend server implemented in Golang for
                    handling device communication and user data.

                    Key Features:

                    Device Control: Users can turn on/off lights, adjust thermostats, and manage other connected devices
                    from the app.
                    User Authentication: Secure login with OAuth integration for personalized access.
                    Real-Time Updates: Uses WebSocket connections for instant updates on device statuses.
                    Voice Commands: Supports voice control through integration with virtual assistants like Google
                    Assistant.
                    Activity Logs: Tracks and displays a history of user actions for security and monitoring.
                    This project showcases skills in full-stack mobile app development, backend API integration,
                    real-time data handling, and user interface design.</p>
